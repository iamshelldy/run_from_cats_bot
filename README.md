# Run from cats 

This module implements a Telegram bot that allows players
to engage in a game where the goal is to evade cats on a
grid-like field. The bot supports starting new games, player
movements, and saving/loading game progress.

## Game Logic
Cats move towards the player using Manhattan distance
to simulate chasing behavior. Obstacles and cats are dynamically
generated to keep the game unpredictable.

## Telegram Integration
The bot uses Telegram's API to handle user input, send messages,
and manage game sessions.
